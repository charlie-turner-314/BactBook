# Bactbook
This projects user interface is built off of the existing Staphbook project. The original README.md file is below.
This project aims to provide the staphbook functionality to the bactopia pipeline, enabling data visualization of all bacteria types.

# Staphbook
"A social network for genomes"

StaphBook is a web app that reads from a PostgreSQL database and displays *Staphylococcus aureus* genomes in an easy to read format. With this app users are able to:
- browse genomes and view information such as isolation source and sequence data and be able to download the information as .csv files.
- find similar genomes by shared information such as isolation sources and by genetic distance
- favorite and tag samples by adding them to a group which can then be shared and viewed by other users
- annotate groups and view generic statistics about each group
